To All Valued Team Members,

I want to start by saying how much I appreciate each and every one of you for your tireless dedication to our mission of 
||groundbreaking innovation||
. 
Recently, it’s come to my attention that some of you may have concerns about the current workload and our demanding project 
timelines. Your health and well-being are important to us, and we are committed to fostering a 
||sustainable work environment||
.

That’s why I’m excited to announce some refreshing changes. 
Starting next month, we’ll be implementing a 
||reduced crunch schedule||
, so you’ll have the option to finish your 80-hour weeks in just six days instead of seven. 
Additionally, we’re exploring the possibility of a brand-new 
||water cooler||
, which will be conveniently located 
||near the breakroom||
, to make those all-important moments of relaxation even easier to fit into your busy schedules.

For our upcoming release, I’m also happy to confirm that we will be considering more 
||flexible restroom breaks||
. We believe that with the right 
||can-do attitude||
, our team can strike the perfect balance between productivity and comfort.

Thank you for your continued commitment to our success. 
Together, I’m confident we can meet our ambitious goals, deliver an 
||exceptional product||
, and redefine what it means to be a 
||thriving workplace||
.

Warm regards,
Your Very Appreciative CEO
