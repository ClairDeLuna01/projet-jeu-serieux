Dear Esteemed Shareholders,

I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for any confusion 
or doubt surrounding our recent initiatives involving 
NFTs, AI, cryptocurrencies, and other innovative revenue streams like 
||metaverse land sales||
. 
Please understand that my commitment to these revolutionary technologies comes from 
a place of deep admiration for their potential to 
||drive shareholder value||
. While some may see these advancements as distracting or controversial, 
I assure you, we remain focused on our core mission: ensuring 
||infinite growth||
, regardless of market trends or consumer preferences.

I realize that some of our decisions may have been perceived as boldâ€”perhaps 
even risky. But in this fast-evolving digital landscape, it's vital that we lean 
into trends like 
||blockchain-based loot boxes|| 
and AI-generated content. Not because they enhance the player experience, 
but because they allow us to 
||unlock new profit margins||
. Rest assured, every action I take is with the sole intention of 
||maximizing your returns||
. We believe that by continuing down this path, we can create an ecosystem 
where our games are not just entertainment but lucrative investment opportunities.

I hope this clarifies any concerns you may have had, and I look forward to 
||pushing the boundaries of profitability|| 
together. 
Thank you for your trust and continued support as we boldly step into the 
||crypto-enabled future||
.

Sincerely,
Your Loyal CEO
