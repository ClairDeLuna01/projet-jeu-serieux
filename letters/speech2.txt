Thanks for coming, everyone! 
We've heard your complaints loud and clear, but let's get one thing straight: times have changed. 
Games aren't just about fun anymore -- they're serious business. 
You all say you want 'passion projects' and 'creativity,' but the truth is, we know what you really want: flashy graphics, microtransactions, and premium content to flex on your friends. 
So yes, we're focusing on NFTs, AI, and exclusive paywalls because that's where the industry is heading, whether you like it or not. 
If you're still hung up on the 'good old days,' maybe it's time to find another hobby. We're here to innovate, not pander to nostalgia.
